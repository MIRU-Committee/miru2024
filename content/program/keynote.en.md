### Title: How do humans connect the continuous visual world and discrete linguistic symbols? 

### Abstract: 
Language divides the continuous visual world into discrete categories and names them. Lexical categories do not encode all features existing in the world in their meanings: Only a single, or a limited number of features are packed into words. In this talk, I explore how humans connect the visual world and discrete linguistic categories. For this exploration, I address the following questions: How do words --nouns, verbs and adjectives-- extract the essence of the objects, action events, and properties in the world?  Are there any universal concepts that are codified across all languages?  How does diversity in linguistic codification of the world arise? How do human children anchor words onto a continuous visual world? How do they construct a vast system of lexical symbols, which even contain concepts that cannot be mapped onto visual reality

### Title: JIZAI Body: beyond human limits

### Abstract: 
Social revolutions have been accompanied by innovations in the perception of the body. If we consider the information revolution as the digital transformation of physical society into a cyber society, it will be necessary to construct a "JIZAI body" (a virtual cyborg) that can freely adapt to these changes and establish a new perspective on the body. In this presentation, we will introduce our efforts to construct the "JIZAI body" based on virtual reality, robotics, and wearable technology. Furthermore, we will discuss implicit support technologies for realizing human-machine integration and support for skill transfer and acquisition.
