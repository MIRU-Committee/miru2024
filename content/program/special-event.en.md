title: "MIRU2024 Special Session: MIRU – Broader perspectives and deeper pursuits
"
---

In the 32-year history of MIRU, there has never been a time when the research fields related to image recognition and understanding have shown such diverse development as they are doing now. However, it is precisely at times like this that we need to try to identify the problems that truly need to be solved, set our sights on them, and pursue the essence of relevant technologies. With this in mind, we have invited three up and coming researchers who have already become pioneers in their respective fields and are leading laboratories based on their own unique perspectives to participate in this year's special program. We will ask them, in the form of a panel discussion,  how to identify problems, how to deepen research, about their experiences of collaborating with people from different fields or different perspectives, and the working points they have found to be important in promoting research projects.
