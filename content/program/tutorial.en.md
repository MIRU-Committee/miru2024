### Title: Vision Technologies for Autonomous Driving

### Abstract: 
Computer vision provides indispensable technologies for autonomous driving. Achieving safe and reliable autonomous driving requires solving various visual tasks in real time with sufficiently high accurately, including object detection, tracking, 3D localization, traffic sign recognition, road structure recognition, and even estimation of the intentions of road users. In this respect, autonomous driving is like a "dojo for vision technology." In this tutorial, we will introduce recent vision technologies related to autonomous driving, and discuss remaining challenges and future prospects.

### Title: Performance Evaluation for Computer Vision Research

### Abstract: 
Research in computer vision inherently involves evaluation experiments, which validate ideas and facilitate comparisons between various methods. The development of standardized evaluation methods significantly boosts the advancement of this field. In this tutorial, I will explore these evaluation methods, focusing on aspects such as data, measures, and tasks. Furthermore, this tutorial will discuss the requirements of an effective evaluation and the impact that the adoption of a specific evaluation method can have on its research field. This discussion will be based on trends in computer vision as well as in related fields such as natural language processing.

### Title: Scene state estimation using various sensors and modalities

### Abstract: 
When estimating the scene state in a real-world environment, we need to consider various aspects such as the impact on estimation accuracy due to lighting conditions or occlusions, the resource cost such as memory and power consumption, and the privacy of personal information in captured data. On the other hand, even if there are constraints that are difficult to solve with a certain measurement, it may be possible to partially resolve them by using other measurements or modalities. This tutorial discusses the merits and demerits of various measurement methods using visible light sensors such as event cameras and transient cameras, as well as modalities other than visible light such as wireless signals and acoustic signals. I will also discuss the challenges and prospects when dealing with these methods for scene state estimation tasks such as human posture estimation and 3D shape reconstruction, based on the latest research trends.
