Town Meeting is a forum for exchanging opinions on the future of MIRU. The aim is to share information about the proposals received by MIRU committees and the background to them, as well as to exchange opinions among participants, in order to make MIRU even better in the future.
Topics will include:

- Publication of Extended Abstracts (or Proceedings) in future MIRU,
- Collaboration between MIRU and academic journals, and
- The optimal schedule for holding MIRU.

However, the topics will not be limited to these, and we ask that you also actively speak up from the audience as time allows.
After the Interactive Sessions on Wednesday, please return to the 4F Main Hall and participate in the Town Meeting.
