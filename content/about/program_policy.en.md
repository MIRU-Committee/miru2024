# Introduction

The Japanese Meeting on Image Recognition and Understanding (short MIRU) has been managed by people in this community since 1992. As the community grows, the number of participants in MIRU also continues to increase annually. With such changes, the program policies of MIRU have also evolved over time. For more details, please refer to the [MIRU2023 Program Policy](https://cvim.ipsj.or.jp/MIRU2023/program-policy/) page.


# MIRU 2024 Organization Policy

Compared to MIRU 2023, **the main changes** are as follows:

-	The symposium will be held **on-site** (in-person).
-	All oral presentations are in **single-track sessions**.
-	Oral presentations are an opportunity to convey a research idea to all symposium participants. Poster presentations are an opportunity for discussion and exchange among participants. Following, the **Q&A for all submitted papers and invited talks will be held in the interactive session through poster presentations**.
-	To maximize the number of possible oral presentations, there is **no distinction between long and short presentations**.

Our goal for MIRU 2024 is to provide a valuable experience for attendees, presenters, and the community by adhering to the following considerations in our program:


## 1. As a presenter, you can highlight your research to many people and receive valuable feedback.

-	MIRU provides an opportunity to nurture and grow emerging, challenging research in Japan.
-	Oral presentations are an opportunity to cultivate and establish research which is not yet at a stage to be accepted at an international conference or journal.
-	When selecting oral presentations, we value challenging and emerging research, as well as those which are inspiring and informative to other researchers. Non-oral presentations are presented as posters. All submitted papers which fit the target of MIRU can be presented at the event, and there are no rejections. Due to this, since MIRU 2017 the phrasing “reviewing” has been changed to “evaluating”.
-	In recent years, there have been more than 1000 participants per year, which makes MIRU a fruitful event to promote new ideas to a large audience.
-	MIRU tries to motivate researchers to work towards top international conferences. Since MIRU 2023, we have the research mentorship program which supports researchers towards submitting to top conferences in the field of computer vision. The program is open for application when submitting to the oral presentation proposal track.
-	Due to time constraints during oral presentations, we provide the interactive session as a means for presenters to discuss their work in an additional poster presentation. All submitted papers, including invited papers, can be discussed during the interactive sessions.
-	The interactive session also hosts demonstrations, including those which need some physical setup.
-	Research papers which have already been published or presented at other conferences or journals cannot be submitted to the oral presentation proposal track. However, you are encouraged to submit them to the Poster Presentation track. This allows you to discuss previous work, which you may have presented internationally, with the domestic audience at MIRU during the interactive session.


## 2. As a participant, you can learn about the field as a whole, study the newest research directions, and socialize with top domestic researchers.

-	MIRU is the largest domestic symposium in the field of image recognition and understanding with over 400 research presentations per year. This allows you to fully grasp and review the Japanese developments in this field.
-	We offer opportunities to learn about cutting-edge efforts in the field. Recent work from top-conference and top-journal papers of related fields is presented as invited talks. Latest developments in image recognition and understanding are introduced during tutorial sessions.
-	We foster collaborations between industry and academia. In recent years, AI has advanced greatly, and many corporations have begun developing related products and expanding their businesses incorporating such technologies. MIRU aims to provide opportunities for exchange between academia and industry, allowing both parties to deepen their understanding of each other’s work. This can generate new ideas through synergies between both parties. To achieve this, we offer corporate sponsor booths during the interactive sessions. Furthermore, we host corporate events such as Luncheons.
-	MIRU provides opportunities for researchers to meet each other, exchange opinions, and collaborate on research projects. To facilitate this, we plan social events open to all participants (please note that these plans are subject to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions or similar), which include award sessions and alike. 


## 3. As a community, we have a platform for nurturing and promoting Japanese cutting-edge research and make it ready for the international stage.

-	We invite authors of papers accepted at top conferences or journals to be invited speakers, to share not only their research, but also the process of how to produce high-quality, peer-reviewed research papers that can withstand tough competition. We hope this can inspire especially students and young researchers to challenge themselves at top conferences.
-	MIRU has several awards in place, including the Nagao award of outstanding research, best paper awards, student paper awards, and frontier awards which are selected by the award committee members from all oral presentation papers. Additionally, in MIRU 2024, we introduce an audience award for oral presentation papers which is voted on by all participants. For poster presentations and demo presentations in the interactive session, there are interactive session awards and demo awards, which are also voted on by all participants.  Lastly, there are encouragement awards for student participants, which encourages them to further advance their research and challenge themselves at top references.
-	We continue a system introduced in MIRU 2022 which features paper evaluations by young researchers. For young researchers, understanding other researchers’ evaluations of the same paper can be a valuable learning opportunity to understand diverse value systems and evaluation angels. This experience can help to imagine a readers’ (reviewers’) perspective, further nurturing their paper writing skills. Therefore, after selecting oral presentation papers, we share anonymous evaluation reports from other researchers on the same paper.
-	There is a MIRU Young Researchers Program for students and young researchers (including all those who self-identify as young, there’s no age check!) This program, held before or after the MIRU main event, allows for closer interaction and collaboration among participants. We hope that a network of next-generation leaders in the field will emerge from this program.
